# Step 1
Please install all dependencies by npm install

# Express.js
is the basic backend
# Cors
We use cors so that our web browser recognises our express server
# Knex
We use the knex package to connect to our database and also to input queries into our database


Run the server.js file first on port 3000
use the command nodemon server.js

connect your own postgres database credentials to the server file

Run the rest of the application by npm start
